      "La Sagrada Familia is an UNESCO heritage site. It was designated as an UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. It was recieved because of its unique architecture.",
      "The construction of La Sagrada Familia took more than a century. When Gaudi first started this project this 1882, he couldn't finish a quarter of it by his death at 1926, but now it's almost finished and hoping to end the construction by 2026.",
      "There was a school where La Sagrada Familia is now, Gaudi built a school called Sagrada Familia School to educate construction workers' children while they working on building La Sagrada Familia ",
      'The architect of this structural monument is buried here too. After the death Antoni Gaudi, he was interred in a chapel called El Carmen Virgin, visitors can come see this tomb themselves. .',

      "Most of the carving was done by exploding dynamites. In order to make the work faster, the sculptor blasted 90% of the rock face to carve the faces",
      "Four former Presidents of USA are carved in this rock, they are George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.",
      "Workers hung from 3/8 inch steel cables with sculpting equipment and remarkbly no one died during the Mount Rushmore's construction. ",
      'Thomas Jefferson face was initially supposed to be on right of George Washington, but it was moved to left when they found that the granite there was full of quartz. .',

      "The center of the former Ryukyu Kingdom, Okinawa Main Island (沖縄本島, Okinawa Hontō) is by far the largest and most populous island in Okinawa Prefecture and the regional transportation hub. The prefectural capital Naha and most of the US military bases are located here. While much of the central part of Okinawa Honto is urbanized, the southern tip and the northern third of the island are less densely populated, while the northernmost Yanbaru Region remains mainly covered by forested hills and small fishing and farming villages.",

      "Dubbed the “Hawaii of Japan”, the eponymous main island is just one of more than 160 that make up the Okinawa prefecture – an archipelago trailing like a strand of pearls towards Taiwan. Some of the islands are inhabited, simply a slip of untouched white sand lapped by azure seas, while others are scattered with luxury resorts at the edge of pristine dive sites.",
      "Winter is a no-go in Okinawa. While the rest of Japan shivers through winter, it can still reach a tropical 20°C here in the colder months.",
      "You’ll also find Japan’s largest reef in the prefecture, and Okinawa is home to the country’s best dive sites with spectacular diving available throughout the islands.",

      "The North Rim is closed in winter, but the South Rim and West Rim are open year-round and easily accessible from tourist destinations like Las Vegas, Phoenix, Sedona, Flagstaff, and Williams.",
      "The main access point for the South Rim is the South Entrance, where the main visitor center is located.",
      "From the South Entrance Visitor Center, you have two main options for exploring the park by road: Hermit Road runs west, past the small resort area of Grand Canyon Village, more commonly known as the Village, to numerous overlooks.",
